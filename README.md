### About me
I'm a junior web developer with a focus on JS development and a specialization in UX. I have been learning and working with both frontend and backend technologies.

I learned and developed frontend projects with HTML5 and CSS3 and I am currently learning backend programming using Node.js, Express, Nunjucks and Postgres as a database.
